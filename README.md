# Inventory app
Project 7 for Udacity - Android Basics Nanodegree program

## **First stage of the app:**

In this project I designed and created the structure of a Inventory App that will allow a store to keep track 
of its inventory of products. The app will need to store information about the product and allow the user to track 
sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier. 

This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:
- Creating a SQLite table in your app
- Populating that table with new entries
- Modifying the entries
- Displaying the contents of the table to users
