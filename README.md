# Inventory app
Project 7 for Udacity - Android Basics Nanodegree program

In this project I designed and created the structure of a Inventory App that will allow a store to keep track 
of its inventory of products. The app will need to store information about the product and allow the user to track 
sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier. I put together my knowledge of app planning, navigating between multiple activities, databases, networking, and UI development into one app.

## **First stage of the app**

In Stage 1 I designed and implemented the backend database that stores information about the products and suppliers.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:
- Creating a SQLite table in your app
- Populating that table with new entries
- Modifying the entries
- Displaying the contents of the table to users

## **Second stage of the app**

In Stage 2 I built out the app UI for users to add and remove inventory.

- Storing information in a SQLite database
- Integrating Android’s file storage systems into that database
- Setting up a Content Provider and use it to access a repository of data
- Presenting information from files and SQLite databases to users
- Updating information based on user input
- Creating intents to other apps using stored information
